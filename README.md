# PacMan

In this exercise, I created PacMen with the click of a button and each of them will move about the browser window at their own pace. 

In this exercise, I've created a web page that produces a PacMan on the click of a button by using the array methods I've learned previously and the new techniques I've learned for manipulating the DOM.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to install http-server.

```bash
npm install http-server
```

## How to run

```bash
# after cloning the repo navigate to project directory
cd PATH/PecMan

# load http-server 
http-server  # on Windows (http-server.cmd)

# http-server will return the available localhost ports that running the local server
# Available on:
#  http://127.0.0.1:8080 <-- in my case

# open the available URL in your browser 
```
